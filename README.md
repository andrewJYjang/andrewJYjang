I'm in pursuit of driving social impact by empowering innovators to use emerging technologies, and leveraging digital transformation to create solutions for humanity's challenges.
As an author of 'Coding Era', which was selected as a Sejong Book, I am deeply aware that the changes I predicted for the future of society are now almost entirely becoming reality. This realization brings me an even greater sense of responsibility for the role and impact I carry forward.
